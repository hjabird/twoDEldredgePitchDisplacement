Based on a smooth pitching motion function from Eldridge 2009.

In Julia the function looks like (copied from K Ramesh's UNSFlow):
```
immutable EldUpDef <: MotionDef
    amp :: Float64  // Amplitude
    K :: Float64    // pitch rate non-dimensional parameter
    a :: Float64    // relation trasition speed
end

function (eld::EldUpDef)(t)
    sm = pi*pi*eld.K/(2*(eld.amp)*(1 - eld.a))
    t1 = c / U // Modified to consider time
    t2 = t1 + ((eld.amp)/(2*eld.K)) * c / U
    ((eld.K/sm)*log(cosh(sm*(t - t1))/cosh(sm*(t - t2))))+(eld.amp/2)
end
```
